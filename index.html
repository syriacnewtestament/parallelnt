                        <p>
                          John Wesley Etheridge (Feb 24, 1804- May 24, 1866), an English Methodist, a Wesleyan minister and nonconformist divine,
                          was born to John and Alley (Gray) Etheridge in Youngwoods near Newport, in the Isle of Wight, on
                          the 24th of February 1804.
                        </p>
                        <b>Childhood & Ministry:</b>
                        <p>
                          He was the third of seven children. He received most of his early education from his father who was master of an academy
                          of Portsea. Though he never attended any university he acquired ultimately a thorough knowledge
                          of Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, French and German. In 1824 he was placed on the Wesleyan Methodist
                          plan as a local preacher.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In 1827 his offer to enter the ministry was accepted, and after the usual probationary trial he was received into full connexion
                          at the conference of 1831. He married Eliza Middleton in that same year. For two years after this
                          he remained at Brighton, and in 1833 he removed to Cornwall, being stationed successively at the
                          Truro and Falmouth circuits. From Falmouth he removed to Darlaston, where in 1838 his health gave
                          way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For a good many years he was a supernumerary, and lived for a while at Caen and Paris, where in the public libraries he found
                          great facilities for prosecuting his favorite subject which was Oriental studies. His health having
                          considerably improved, he became, in 1843, pastor of the Methodist church at Boulogne. He returned
                          to England in 1847, and was appointed successively to the circuits of Islington, Bristol, Leeds,
                          Penzance, Penryn, Truro and St Austell in east Cornwall. Shortly after his return to England he
                          received the degree of Ph.D. from the university of Heidelberg. He was a patient, modest, hard-working
                          and accurate scholar.
                        </p>

                          After graduation, he became Preceptor of the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut.
                          In 1799, he took charge, for one year, of Hamilton Oneida Academy, now Hamilton College, at Clinton,
                          New York.

                        <b>Childhood & Ministry:</b>
                        <p>
                          He married Rebecca Lydia (born Atwater) Murdock on October of 1799 and they had 10 children. He was licensed as a Congregational
                          minister in January, 1801. In February, 1802, he received a call to settle in Princeton County
                          Massachusetts, and was ordained there. In 1815, he resigned his pastoral charge and was appointed
                          Professor of the learned languages in the University of Vermont. He moved to Burlington, Vermont
                          where he was Professor of the learned languages and Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy.
                          In 1818, he became Professor of Languages. In the spring of 1819, being appointed Brown Professor
                          of Sacred Rhetoric and Ecclesiastical History in the Theological Seminary at Andover, he left Vermont
                          and returned to Massachusetts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In the autumn of that year, Harvard University conferred on him the honorary degree of S.T.D.(Doctor of Sacred Theology)
                          Difficulties soon afterwards arose between him and the other Professors, respecting his course
                          of duties in the Seminary which continued several years, until in 1828 when he decided to leave
                          the Institution. He moved to New Haven in 1829, where he continued to reside. He retired from public
                          life, and devoted himself to private studies and especially to Ecclesiastical History.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                          For a few years he preached and delivered lectures in different places, but of late seldom appeared as a public speaker.
                          He was made an honorary member of the New York Historical Society several. He was also Vice President,
                          and recently President, of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as Vice President
                          of the Philological Society of Connecticut, of which he was one of the original founders. He was
                          also one of the founders and corporate members of the American Oriental Society, and a regular
                          contributor to its learned Journal. This was an Association of Oriental Scholars, so select and
                          exclusive that it had no honorary members in America, only three in England, a few on the continent
                          of Europe, and a few in Asia.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                          In the Autumn of 1855, Dr. Murdock went to Columbus, Mississippi, where he spent a delightful winter in the family of his
                          son, visiting various portions of the Southern country, and anticipating a return to New Haven
                          in the ensuing Spring, his strength gave way, and he died on August 10, 1856.

                        <b>Author:</b>
                        <p>
                          George M. Lamsa (August 5, 1892 - September 22, 1975) was born in a small village called Marbishu (Mar Behishu) which was
                          located in the Kurdish mountains at the corner of southeast Turkey. His village was a few miles
                          from the Iran and Iraq borders. He was the son of Jando and Sarah. He had two sisters. The family
                          last name was not known.
                        </p>
                        <b>Education:</b>
                        <p>
                          His elementary education was at a small Presbyterian School and his secondary and post secondary education was at the Archbishop
                          of Canterbury’s Mission to Assyrian Christians school. He distinguished himself through his excellent
                          work and good grades and as a result was able to get a job as a teacher. After a few years of teaching,
                          he moved to a new school opened in Van (Turkey). He had to move around a number of times in response
                          to the persecution of the Armenians which led up to the impeding collapse of the Ottoman empire
                          and the start of World War One.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                          Finally in 1913, he had to flee local authorities in Istanbul who were sent to the University where he was employed. He traveled
                          to Bulgaria and Italy and finally ended up Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1917, he earned enough money
                          to emigrated to New York City. In 1919, he earned a scholarship to the Episcopal Theological Seminary
                          in Virginia, where he studied for three years.
                        </p>
                        <b>Ministry:</b>
                        <p>
                          He then moved to Washington D.C., where, he assisted the Archbishop of Canterbury raise funds for the reconstruction of war-damaged
                          schools in Turkey. In 1923, Lamsa was able to print his first book "The Secret of the Near East"
                          this helped to promote his work with the Archbishop of Canterbury's mission in Turkey. His second
                          book, "The Oldest Christian People" which was co-authored by William Chauncey Emhardt was published
                          in 1926. William Chauncey Emhardt was the head of the Missions Committee of the Episcopal Church
                          in the United States. Lamsa traveled and spoke promoting the cause of the Christians in the East
                          through the Association Assyrian St. Ephram which was a group organized to raise money for the
                          Christian refugees as a result of World War One.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It was supported by the American Protestant Episcopal Church. Through various private donors, between 1927 and 1930, he was
                          able to publish his third book, entitled "My Neighbor Jesus". Shortly thereafter, he started to
                          translate "The Four Gospels According to the Eastern Version". He finished and published the four
                          Gospels in 1933. It was published by the A.J Holman Publishing Company which was located in Philadelphia.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                          Lamsa continued to lecture at various churches. Through these lectures, he gained a number of benefactors that supported
                          him regularly throughout his publishing, writing and translation career. He finished and published
                          the entire New Testament in 1940. In the autumn of 1940, he began to translation the Old Testament.
                          Lamsa was a student at Dropsie College of Hebrew and Cognate Learning between 1944-1945 but never
                          received a degree. In 1957, when the entire Bible was published, his lecturing schedule greatly
                          increased. He soon was spending much of his time giving radio interviews, speaking and traveling.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                          Lamsa believed in the ecumenical Christian Church and accepted any and all invitations to speak. He also tried to promote
                          greater cooperation and understanding between Christians, Jews and Moslems. He died on September
                          22, 1975.
